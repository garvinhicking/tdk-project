This is an initialization file.

The directory `typo3-core` is mandatory, because this will receive the
GIT working directory of TYPO3.

It is listed as a local "repository" inside composer.json.

This is the only file that is allowed to be versioned. Only if it is the
only file in this directory, the tdk-core composer-plugin is able to
check out the GIT sources into this directory.

This file is called "composer-repository.bak" because the TYPO3-core lists 
`*.bak` as gitignored files.
